        "6": {
          "question": "How can I reduce the noise level of the hood if it is too high?",
          "answer": "The noise caused by the air that is fed in operation by the hood. We have the internal components of our hoods designed so that the air flow encounters on its way through the hood only to a few obstacles. In this way, the efficiency is increased and the noise is attenuated. An increase in noise level can be avoided effectively by the air discharge good sized lines (120 to 150 mm in diameter) are used. Contaminated or saturated filter can obstruct the air flow: Regular cleaning (or a regular exchange) of filters provides an unobstructed air flow."

          "question": "What is the best way to install a cooker hood?",
          "answer": "The hood must be a minimum distance of 65 cm be installed on the hob. We recommend a distance of 75 cm not to exceed the hob so that the cooking vapours is still effectively extracted. Some models allow a lower minimum distance - please check the relevant Installation Instructions for your hood. The air evacuated must also be made on the hood as close as possible. Select lines with a diameter of 150 mm (but not less than 120 mm) which is not longer than 3-4 m and have a maximum of two changes in direction. WARNING: The warranty does not cover damage caused by failure to observe the minimum safety distances."

        "8": {
          "answer": "Most models can be installed in either mode, however the best method is that the hood is ducted out of an exterior wall, since it is the most effective, safest and quietest solution.",

        },
        "9": {
          "question": "How do I determine which model of hood it is?",
          "answer": "The model of the hood is indicated on the label on the product (to be able to see the type label, remove the metal mesh filter). The corresponding numerical code at the top right, consists of 7 or 9 digits, starting with 63 ... or 10-digit format 110.xxxx.xxx."
        },
        "10": {
          "question": "Why does the technical customer service not deal with aesthetic defects?",

          "question": "What is the purpose of the filters? How often do I need to replace them?",
          "answer": "Filters are an integral part of the hood and its maintenance affect the efficiency, safety and noise level of the hood off. Anti-grease filters protect the engine from fat contained in sucked by the hood extractor. The metal filter of Franke hoods ensure a high deposition rate of fat particles. In order to obtain the efficiency of the filter, it should be cleaned every two months by hand or in the dishwasher on average. That may be used in many older models synthetic filters, can not be washed and should be replaced about every two months when fat has accumulated in them. The odor filters are activated carbon cartridges, which are used exclusively in the filter variant of hoods. You are not washable and must periodically - to be replaced - on average every three months."

          "answer": "Yes. Any sink that has a 3 1/2“ waste (90mm) is capable of having a waste disposal unit connected. For Franke ceramic sinks an Extended Flange is available for Continuous Feed models. If your sink has an overflow you may need to purchase a WDU Overflow Converter, available from our [service agents](https://www.central-servicesuk.co.uk/new/wdu-overflow-connector).\nYou can view videos on Franke Waste Disposal Units on our [YouTube/UKFranke](http://www.youtube.com/UKFranke) channel.",

Simple removal of the logo plate reveals the overflow aperture for easy, hygienic cleaning. Most Franke sinks have rigid overflow pipes and can be cleaned by pouring boiling water into them. Alternatively use a proprietary cleaner."
        },

          "question": "How do I apply earthing to a Franke sink?",
          "answer": "Despite any regulatory enforcement, in common with many sink manufacturers Franke make provision for a mechanical bond to be made to inset sink models. This is often done by utilising one of the cut-out points for the clips along the length of the clip rail. In the case of sliding clips Franke make a hole at the end of the clip rail length where the bond can be accommodated."
        },
        "6": {
          "answer": "This depends on the worktop but we would recommend that you seek professional advice. A template and fixing clips are provided in the box. Some circumstances may allow for fitting a bowl directly to the worktop. Alternatively a plywood template can be made to the size of the sink, which will effectively 'sandwich' the sink flange, when addressed to the underside of the material. We would recommend the use of a sealant between the flange of the sink and the worktop to avoid any water ingress. In all cases you are advised to consult your supplier.",

          "question": "How can I remove 'rust spots' from my new stainless steel sink?",
          "answer": "Your sink is made from high quality 18/10 chrome nickel steel. That means it’s metallurgically incapable of rusting or corroding in normal household conditions. If rust and corrosion problems do occur, tiny iron particles deposited on the surface will be the culprit. These either come from the water supply or are left behind by wire scouring pads or utensils. It’s essential to clean off these filings and dry the sink thoroughly afterwards. If you let them stick around, they’ll cause rust.  \nIf you want to remove any rust stains from your products, we recommend using a cleaning agent containing oxalic acid (e.g. Bar Keepers Friend®). Always use mild, non-abrasive cleaning agents such as Franke Stainless Steel Sink Cleaner to remove stubborn stains from your stainless steel and make sure you thoroughly rinse away any cleaning liquids once finished. Oh, one more thing, when cleaning your stainless steel, NEVER USE STEEL WOOL PADS. We, and our stainless steel, thank you in advance.\nWe would point out that unless the particles are completely removed they will return. It is therefore very important that after cleaning the sink, it is dried thoroughly - a Franke Microfiber Cloth is ideal. This process needs to continue until the problem disappears. The problem is sometimes particularly obstinate to remove and it may take several attempts to restore the sink to its pristine condition.\nBoth Franke products can be purchased [here](https://www.central-servicesuk.co.uk/new/care-and-repair)."
