          "answer": "Check if the installation was carried out according to the steps described in the instructions of the hood or ask the installer to check this. If the installation was done properly and the sound actually comes from the product, you should contact the authorized technical customer service.",
          "question": "The hood vibrates unusually strongly. What should I do?"
        },
        "3": {
          "answer": "Check if the installation was carried out according to the steps described in the instructions of the hood or ask the installer to check this. If the installation was done properly and the weak suction is in fact due to a defect in the product, you should contact the authorized technical customer service.",

          "question": "How do I order accessories or spare parts for the hood?",
          "answer": "You can order accessories and spare parts in our online store. Or you can contact the technical customer service and specify the model of the hood to order all the necessary accessories and spare parts."
        },

        "6": {
          "question": "How can I reduce the noise level of the hood if it is too high?",
          "answer": "Excessive noise could be caused by the installation and the arrangement of the ducting. The least obstacles the airflow encounters (e.g. corners) on it's way to the final vent will reduce noise. Adequate sized ducting (e.g. 150mm) will also assist in reducing nose levels.\nRegular cleaning (or a regular exchange) of filters provides an unobstructed air flow."
        },
        "7": {
          "question": "What is the best way to install a cooker hood?",
          "answer": "The hood must be a minimum distance of 65 cm be installed on the hob. We recommend a distance of 75 cm not to exceed the hob so that the cooking vapours are still effectively extracted. The air evacuated must also be made on the hood as close as possible. Select lines with a diameter of 150 mm (but not less than 120 mm) which is not longer than 3-4 m and have a maximum of two changes in direction. WARNING: The warranty does not cover damage caused by failure to observe the minimum safety distances."
        },

          "answer": "We recommend that the exhaust air variant, since it is the most effective, safest and quietest solution.",
          "question": "Is it better to use exhaust or recirculation type of hoods?"
        },
        "9": {
          "question": "How do I determine which model of hood it is?",
          "answer": "The model of the hood is indicated on the label on the product (to be able to see the type label, remove the metal mesh filter). The corresponding numerical code at the top right, consists of 7 or 9 digits, starting with 63 ... or 10-digit format 110.xxxx.xxx."
        },
        "10": {
          "question": "Why does the technical customer service not deal with aesthetic defects?",
          "answer": "Aesthetic defects must be rejected immediately by the installer during the installation or on opening the package the hood. Later complaints can not be accepted as warranty claims and any support from the technical customer service takes place outside the guarantee."
        },
        "11": {
          "question": "How to clean the hood?",
          "answer": "It's easy to keep the hood nice and clean: you just need a soft cloth and the surface not to damage a neutral, chlorine-free detergent."
        },
        "12": {
          "question": "What is the purpose of the filters? How often do I need to replace them?",
          "answer": "Filters are an integral part of the hood and its maintenance affect the efficiency, safety and noise level of the hood off. Anti-grease filters protect the engine from fat contained in sucked by the hood extractor. The metal filter of Franke hoods ensure a high deposition rate of fat particles. In order to obtain the efficiency of the filter, it should be cleaned every two months by hand or in the dishwasher on average. That may be used in many older models synthetic filters, can not be washed and should be replaced about every two months when fat has accumulated in them. The odour filters are activated carbon cartridges, which are used exclusively in the filter variant of hoods. They are not washable and must periodically be replaced on average every three months."
        },
        "13": {
          "answer": "A ducting diameter of 150 mm. This diameter is ideal for hoods with an extraction capacity of 300 cubic meters per hour and more. If it is not possible to install such a line, a 120 mm diameter line is recommended. Pipes with smaller diameter have a negative impact on the flow and noise level of the hood.",

For Franke ceramic sinks an Extended Flange is available for Continuous Feed models. If your sink has an overflow you may need to purchase a WDU Overflow Converter, available from our [service agents](https://www.central-servicesuk.co.uk/product.php/1583/5/wdu_overflow_connector).\nYou can view videos on Franke Waste Disposal Units on our [YouTube/UKFranke](http://www.youtube.com/UKFranke) channel.",

        "4": {
          "question": "How do I clean the overflow?",
          "answer": "Many Franke sinks come with a Hygienic Overflow, which offers versatility for cleaning. Simple removal of the logo plate reveals the overflow aperture for easy, hygienic cleaning. Most Franke sinks have rigid overflow pipes and can be cleaned by pouring boiling water into them. Alternatively use a proprietary cleaner."
        },
        "5": {
          "question": "How do I apply earthing to a Franke sink?",
          "answer": "Despite any regulatory enforcement, in common with many sink manufacturers Franke make provision for a mechanical bond to be made to inset sink models. This is often done by utilising one of the cut-out points for the clips along the length of the clip rail. In the case of sliding clips Franke make a hole at the end of the clip rail length where the bond can be accommodated."
        },
        "6": {
          "answer": "This depends on the worktop but we would recommend that you seek professional advice. A template and fixing clips are provided in the box. Some circumstances may allow for fitting a bowl directly to the worktop. Alternatively a plywood template can be made to the size of the sink, which will effectively 'sandwich' the sink flange, when addressed to the underside of the material. We would recommend the use of a sealant between the flange of the sink and the worktop to avoid any water ingress. In all cases you are advised to consult your supplier.",

          "question": "I am thinking of installing an inset stainless steel sink into a solid surface worktop, is there anything I need to consider?",

Call our [Consumer Care team](https://www.franke.com/gb/en/hs/support/customer-service.html) and we can advise you."

However, with use and cleaning using a proprietary cleaner such as Franke Stainless Steel Cleaner which you can purchase [here](https://www.central-servicesuk.co.uk/section.php/706/1/)) the stainless steel will eventually build up a patina over the years and the scratching marks will not be as evident.

Leave to work for a few moments and rinse with clean water. Afterwards, polish with a dry cloth - the Franke Microfiber Cloth is ideal. \nYou can view a video of how to clean your Franke stainless steel sink on our [YouTube/UKFranke](http://www.youtube.com/UKFranke) channel.",

        "14": {
          "question": "How can I remove 'rust spots' from my new stainless steel sink?",
          "answer": "Your sink is made from high quality 18/10 chrome nickel steel. That means it’s metallurgically incapable of rusting or corroding in normal household conditions. If rust and corrosion problems do occur, tiny iron particles deposited on the surface will be the culprit. These either come from the water supply or are left behind by wire scouring pads or utensils. It’s essential to clean off these filings and dry the sink thoroughly afterwards. If you let them stick around, they’ll cause rust.  \nIf you want to remove any rust stains from your products, we recommend using a cleaning agent containing oxalic acid (e.g. Bar Keepers Friend®). Always use mild, non-abrasive cleaning agents such as Franke Stainless Steel Sink Cleaner to remove stubborn stains from your stainless steel and make sure you thoroughly rinse away any cleaning liquids once finished. Oh, one more thing, when cleaning your stainless steel, NEVER USE STEEL WOOL PADS. We, and our stainless steel, thank you in advance.\nWe would point out that unless the particles are completely removed they will return. It is therefore very important that after cleaning the sink, it is dried thoroughly - a Franke Microfiber Cloth is ideal. This process needs to continue until the problem disappears. The problem is sometimes particularly obstinate to remove and it may take several attempts to restore the sink to its pristine condition."
